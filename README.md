A 2D game engine for Flash. This project is not being developed anymore.

# Current features
- Multiple render targets with asignable cameras (multiple world views)
- XML tilemaps with support for multiple tilesets
- XML tilesets with toggle/animation support (rough)
- Dynamic chunk-based worlds
- XML chunk definition files with cell shapes to correspond with a tilemap, and entity states
- Custom two-phase 2D collision system utilizing separating axis theorem (only dynamic->static at this time)
